A deck in Artifact is the most important thing you choose before entering a match. It defines your playstyle, strengths and weaknesses, tectics and strategy. [Building a balanced deck](https://ggs.wiki/artifact/guides/deck-building) is one of the keys to victory.

A deck should have at least 40 cards of only two colors and should have 5 heroes (see [cards](https://ggs.wiki/artifact/cards)).
