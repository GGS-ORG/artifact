A deck in Artifact is the most important thing you choose before entering a match. It defines your playstyle, strengths and weaknesses, tactics and strategy. [Building a balanced deck](https://ggs.wiki/artifact/guides/deck-building) is one of the keys to victory.

A deck should have at least 40 cards of only two colors and should have 5 heroes (see [cards](https://ggs.wiki/artifact/cards)).

Since there are 4 different card colors, there are 6 possible types of decks:
 
1. Red/Black
2. Red/Blue
3. Red/Green
4. Black/Blue
5. Black/Green
6. Blue/Green

<!-- TODO: Check if a mono-color deck is possible, if deck naming is possible, what are the possible color orders -->
