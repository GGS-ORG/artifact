Artifact is a digital collectible card game for two players developed by [Valve](https://www.valvesoftware.com). An Artifact match is played on a board with 3 distinct areas (lanes) where players are alternating turns and playing cards from their pre-constructed decks. The goal is to destroy two enemy towers or a tower and an Ancient (details are below).

## Gameplay

Each match is a repeated set of rounds consisting of multiple phases:

* There are two phases for each of the three lanes â€” the **Action Phase** and the **Combat Phase**.
* followed by the **Shopping Phase**.
* and concluded with the **Hero Deployment Phase** (in case there are heroes to deploy).

### Action phase

During the Action Phase players are using their spell cards, equip item cards on heroes an so on. If a player does not want to use a card, then it passes a turn to their opponent. When both player pass, the Combat Phase happens and the game moves to another lane.

### Combat Phase {#combat-phase}

The Combat Phase is where all the damage is calculated for the cards and towers on a specific lane. If a creature or a hero was destroyed, Gold is earned by a respective player.

### Win Condition

A player wins a game when either of the two happens:

* two opponent's towers are destroyed.
* the opponent's Ancient is destroyed.

## Cards

Since Artifact is a card game, [Cards](https://ggs.wiki/artifact/cards) are the key. They can be of a different color, type and with their unique capabilities.

### Card Colors

There are 4 card colors in Artifact: blue, green, red, and black. Each color represent a specific aspect of the gameplay:

* Red color is for bruisers
* Blue is for mages and late game
* Black is for assassins and cross-lane abilities
* Green is for support/summons.

Cards of only two colors can be used in a game by each player. It is defined during [deck-building](https://ggs.wiki/artifact/guides/deck-building).

### Card Types

<!-- Heroes, Creeps, Spell Cards, Items -->

## Decks

A deck is a cornerstone of success in Artifact. [Deck-building](https://ggs.wiki/artifact/guides/deck-building) is a broad topic to be covered separately. The bottom line is this:

* A deck can be of only 2 colors out of 4 available.
* A deck must have 5 Hero Cards.
* A deck should have at least 40 cards total (no upper limit).
