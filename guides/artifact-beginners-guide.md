Artifact is a digital collectible card game for two players developed by [Valve](www.valvesoftware.com).

## Gameplay

A game of Artifact involves two players with their own decks constructed in advance. Players are alternating turns and using cards from their decks on a board with 3 distinct areas (lanes). On each lane a player has a tower that can be destroyed by the opponent. Once destroyed it is replaced by an Ancient that can be destroyed as well.

### Win Condition

A player wins a game when either of the two happens:

* two opponent's towers are destroyed.
* the opponent's Ancient is destroyed.

## Cards

Since Artifact is a card game, [Cards](https://ggs.wiki/artifact/cards) are the key. They can be of a different color, type and with their unique capabilities.

### Card Colors

There are 4 card colors in Artifact: blue, green, red, and black. Each color represent a specific aspect of the gameplay:

* Red color is for bruisers
* Blue is for mages and late game
* Black is for assassins and cross-lane abilities
* Green is for support/summons.

Cards of only two colors can be used in a game by each player. It is defined during [deck-building](https://ggs.wiki/artifact/guides/deck-building).

### Card Types

<!-- Heroes, Creeps, Spell Cards, Items -->

## Decks

A deck is a cornerstone of success in Artifact. [Deck-building](https://ggs.wiki/artifact/guides/deck-building) is a broad topic to be covered separately. The bottom line is this:

* A deck can be of only 2 colors out of 4 available.
* A deck must have 5 Hero Cards.
* A deck should have at least 40 cards total (no upper limit).
