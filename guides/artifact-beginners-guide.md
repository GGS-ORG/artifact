Artifact is a digital collectible card game for two players developed by [Valve](www.valvesoftware.com).

## Gameplay

A game of Artifact involves two players with their own decks constructed in advance. Players are alternating turns and using cards from their decks on a board with 3 distinct areas (lanes). On each lane a player has a tower that can be destroyed by the opponent. Once destroyed it is replaced by an Ancient that can be destroyed as well.

### Win Condition

A player wins a game when either of the two happens:

* two opponent's towers are destroyed.
* the opponent's Ancient is destroyed.
