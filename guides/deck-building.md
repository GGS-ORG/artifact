> Deck building is a significant experience â€” from Gabe's presentation on Artifact.

A deck defines what cards (i.e. opportunities) you have in a match to win. It is a key to success.

## Basics

* A deck should have at least 40 cards
* 5 of them mush be Heroes
* Cards of only 2 colors can be used in a deck

## Choosing Color

Based on your playstyle

## Choosing Deck Size

Control vs. capabilities.
