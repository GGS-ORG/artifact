> Deck building is a significant experience â€” from Gabe's presentation on Artifact.

A deck defines what cards (i.e. opportunities) you have in a match to win. It is a key to success.

## Deck building rules

1. There shall be exactly 5 heroes in a deck
1. A deck shall have at least 40 spell/creature/improvement cards including cards that are coming with heroes automatically.
1. A deck shall have at least 9 item cards

## Choosing Color

Based on your playstyle

## Choosing Deck Size

Control vs. capabilities.
